## Project Overview
- **Name**: Jira Public Presenter
- **Purpose**: Zero-cost, automated pipeline to fetch issues from any Jira Cloud instance and host an interactive, responsive dashboard on GitHub Pages.
- **Audience**: Generic open-source template usable by anyone, not tied to any single organization.
- **Primary Display Target**: Big Office Monitor / Wallboard TV (high-contrast, large text, digital clock).

## Architecture & Security
- **Credentials**: Stored exclusively in **GitHub Secrets** (`JIRA_BASE_URL`, `JIRA_USER_EMAIL`, `JIRA_API_TOKEN`). Never committed to Git.
- **Git Security**: `.env` is strictly ignored in `.gitignore`. Committed `site/data/jira_data.json` contains generic demo issues (`DEMO-101`, etc.) to prevent exposing private company ticket titles when pushed to public GitHub repositories.
- **CI/CD**: `.github/workflows/sync-and-deploy.yml` runs every 3 hours (`0 */3 * * *`) and supports manual `workflow_dispatch`. Runs `scripts/fetch_jira.py` and deploys `site/` to GitHub Pages.

## Jira Cloud REST API Discoveries
- **Auth**: Uses HTTP Basic Auth (`email:token`). Also supports Bearer tokens if personal access tokens are supplied without email.
- **Endpoints**:
  - Agile Board: `/rest/agile/1.0/board/{board_id}/issue` (uses `startAt` offset pagination).
  - JQL Search: `/rest/api/3/search/jql` (Atlassian sunset `/rest/api/3/search` with 410 Gone; the new endpoint uses `nextPageToken` cursor pagination and `isLast` flag).
- **Status Categories**: Map Jira `fields.status.statusCategory.key`:
  - `new` -> To Do
  - `indeterminate` -> In Progress
  - `done` -> Done

## Frontend & Wallboard Modes (`site/`)
- Designed specifically for 1080p and 4K Wallboards and Big Monitors.
- Three distinct view options:
  1. `index.html` (**Active Focus**): Displays only the current active sprint (or top active issues) fitting on screen without scrolling.
  2. `auto-scroll.html` (**Auto-Cycle**): Cycles batches of cards every 12 seconds with progress ticker and pause/play toggle.
  3. `compact-grid.html` (**Dense Grid**): High-density cards fitting dozens of issues simultaneously.
- **Shared Wallboard Engine (`tv-common.js`)**:
  - Live digital clock (HH:MM:SS) and date.
  - In-browser silent background polling from `data/jira_data.json` with visual countdown.
  - Configurable in-browser refresh interval (defaults to 180 min / 3 hours, configurable via UI selector or `?refresh=180` URL param).

## Agent Guidelines & Rules
- Always include a confidence percentage (`0% - 100%`) in responses.
- Ask questions until 100% understood before undertaking tasks.
- Standard timestamp generation: `powershell -Command "Get-Date -Format 'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm'"`.
- Keep this memory file concise and focused on high-value facts.

## Light/Dark Theme Toggle (added 2026-09-21)
- All 3 wallboards (`index.html`, `auto-scroll.html`, `compact-grid.html`) default to dark mode (`<html class="dark">`) but now have a sun/moon toggle button (`#theme-toggle-btn` / `#theme-icon`) next to the clock in the header.
- Logic lives in `tv-common.js` (`initTheme`, `applyTheme`, `toggleTheme`); preference persists per-browser via `localStorage['wallboard-theme']` ('dark' or 'light'), so a kiosk/TV browser keeps its chosen mode across refreshes. Each HTML `<head>` also has a tiny inline script (before the Tailwind CDN `<script>`) that applies the saved theme synchronously to avoid a flash of the wrong theme on load.
- Because the UI uses hardcoded Tailwind utility classes (no `dark:` variants) via the Tailwind CDN script, light mode is implemented as CSS overrides in `style.css` under `html:not(.dark) [class~="..."]` using **exact-token attribute selectors** (`[class~="X"]`), not substring (`[class*="X"]`), to avoid accidentally repainting `hover:`-prefixed utility classes outside of `:hover`. Accent colors (amber/blue/emerald/rose/orange text-*-300/400) are darkened in light mode for contrast; solid accent buttons/icons (bg-blue-600 etc., gradient logo tiles) are explicitly excluded from the neutral text-white→dark override so they stay legible.
- `site/app.js` is orphaned/unused (not referenced by any current HTML page) — a legacy dashboard script, left untouched.
- Verified via a local `http-server` + Playwright screenshot script (not committed) toggling all 3 pages with mock `data/jira_data.json`; no console errors, good contrast in both modes.
